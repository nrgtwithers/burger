1. You are first prompted to type a burger name and submitting it.
1. That burger will then be added under the list called `Burgers to be consumed`.
1. After that, you will be given two buttons besides the burger you just submitted. Those options are to devour it or delete the burger.
1. If you chose the option to `Devour it!` it will go under the list `Burgers devoured`.
1. If you chose the option to delete it, in either list it will be completely removed.

*** Bonus is you can type as many burgers as you want and have all those options on an infinite loop. No pun intended. ***
